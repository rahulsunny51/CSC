Part 1- One of the popular approaaches to solve the priority inversion problem is 'Priority Ceiling'.
In this method each resource (in our case a lock)  is associated with certain priority. We call this priority
as Lock Priority.The priorityis indentified the highest priority process which can access it. So once the priority
of the lock is  identified, each process which tries to access the resource will be associated with lock priority
instead of it's own only till it accesses the lock. Once its releases the lock  it's priority will be set to its
original value. 

Ex: Suppose we have lock resource A with lock priority 100. There is a process 'Test' with priority 50 which accesses 
lock A. When the lock is granted to 'Test', its priority will temporarily be 100 while its accessing lock A. Upon 
releasing the lock its priority is reset to 50. This is repeated for every process accessing the lock A.
